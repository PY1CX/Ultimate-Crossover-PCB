# Ultimate-Crossover-PCB

This is a Crossover PCB that I designed for my own use, it uses the Linkwitz-Riley topology so you can design your own filter with any software that calculates the Linkwitz-Riley topology.

You can make with this board:
- Subwoofer low pass filter with Stereo Input adder
- Two way Filter
- Bandpass Filter
- Everything else that you can imagine

Use at your own risk, if you make a professional PCB please send me a e-mail and send me one as a gift :) 

If find any bugs let me know or send a review via git.
